# About

This repository contains a list of approximately 25 000 of the most common English words,
divided into syllables.

The data is collected from two sources: A list of 180 000 syllabified words released to the public domain through Project Gutenberg, and a list of the most common English words derived from the *[Google Web Trillion Word Corpus](http://googleresearch.blogspot.no/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html)* by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/ngrams/).

### Usage

I generated these files because I needed a large list of syllabified common English words, preferably sorted by prevalence, and couldn't find one readily available on the internet. I hope this repo makes this a tiny bit more accessible.
